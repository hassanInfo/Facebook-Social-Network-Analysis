# Facebook-Social-Network-Analysis
  When analyzing different complex networks, it may be important
to discover communities inside them. Community detection methods 
are useful for social media algorithms to discover people with 
common interests and keep them tightly connected. Community detection
can be used in machine learning to detect groups with similar properties
and extract groups for various reasons, as well as identifying the most 
important and influential nodes.
The project divided into two tasks, determination of the top-k influential
nodes and community partition. For that, we can perform them on Facebook 
Dataset available in this link https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html.
